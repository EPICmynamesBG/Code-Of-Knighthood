	>>Courteous- Just as knights exhibit manners, modern men must also be respectful and do things such as open doors for the lady. Knights are also respectful by treating women as though they are a rare gem.
	>>Loyal- Both knights and modern men show loyalty through their relationships. There is only one true love for a knight which is similar to modern day love in which a man is expected to devote all his love to only one love.
	>>Valor- Their actions are valued above their words. For example, defending a maiden will gain more respect than just giving an oath for their protection.
	>>Honor- In knighthood, honesty and virtue are a knights bread and butter; without it, a knight will lose all sense of self-identity. In modern society, this is like truthfulness. By always telling the truth, a man is maintaining his own sense of honor and self-identity.
