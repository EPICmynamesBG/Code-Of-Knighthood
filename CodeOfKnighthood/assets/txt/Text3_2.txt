	Modern men follow a code of societal guidelines known as the "Bro Code" or "Guy Code". Some aspects of the Code are:
	>> Make the first move. Ask the girl on a date, not the other way around.
	>> Dress casually at a minimum unless otherwise agreed.
	>> Be courteous. Open doors for the lady.
	>> Don't look at other girls! As a guy, this is a great way to subtly show loyalty.
	>> Stay loyal, don't become involved with other women.
	>> Be courageous: defend your date if the situation arises.
	>> Be honest. Always telling the truth is key in a relationship.
